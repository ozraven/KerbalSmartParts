		* Will select nearest object on the same channel as target 
		* Similar logic to altimeter smart part - fire on approach, departure, or both 
		* Works out to 2,000 meters 
		* As placeholder, shares model with radio. Planned to change in future. Will not break craft. 
		
v1.6.1 Version File Update 
		* Updated SmartParts.version file 
		
v1.6.2 Proximity Detector Bug Fixes
